    "# Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "Over the course of this project we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The data is stored in two seperate data sets, [one for DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and [one for TAFE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey). The data used in practice is slightly modified, including changing the encoding to `UTF-8` from the previously utilized `cp2152`.\n",

    "In this project we're interesting in knowing the following:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

    "- Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
