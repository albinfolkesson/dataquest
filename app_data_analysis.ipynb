    "- Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",

Thus, we don't actually have very precise data as the previous figure might be 150,000, 200,000 or anything greater than 100,000. We will have to make due with what we've got and for our purpose very precise data is probably not critical. \n",
